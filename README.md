# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores IPL (Indian Premier League) match data using Python to uncover patterns in team performances, match outcomes, toss impact, and player statistics. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and analyzed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter/Colab

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
- Most frequent Player of the Match winners
- Team-wise toss and match wins
- Analysis of batting first vs. batting second outcomes
- Top venues by number of matches
- Distribution of win margins
- Pie chart of overall team victories
- Detailed ball-by-ball analysis for a sample match

## 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Bar plot of top 10 Player of the Match awardees
- Histogram of result margins
- Pie chart showing percentage wins by top teams
- Line/bar graphs for team-wise performance when batting first/second

## 📂 Dataset
- `matches.csv` (Match-level data)
- `deliveries.csv` (Ball-by-ball data)

👉 Dataset Source: [Kaggle - IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020)

## 💡 Insights
- Toss-winners win ~50% of the matches
- Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings are the most consistent teams
- Certain venues host significantly more matches than others
- Batting second has a slightly better win percentage in some seasons

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Upload `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`
3. Run the cells step-by-step to see the analysis
